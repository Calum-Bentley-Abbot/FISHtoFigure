This tutorial will demonstrate the usage of the FISHtoFigure preprocessor. Here, we will create a single dataset from a series of 9 RNAScope image which can be downloaded from the Tutorial materials directory. These images were taken from an experiemtn into T. brucei infection of mouse brains and are taken of a brain sample from a a naive specimen.

Step 1: Download the 9 images and store them in an empty directory (folder). The images must be named  in a numerical fashion, as demonstrated in this dataset. Please see the user guide for more information on data naming convention.

Step 2: Within the FISHtoFigure preprocessor, provide the path to the directory containing the images in the input folder path field. Click find to commit this directory and run to begin the generation of the concatenated dataset, this will not take long at all.
Running the preprocessor will generate a pair of new files in the input directory comprising the concatenated dataset in both txt and csv format as shown in the tutorial output directory. The txt file can then be used as an input for the main FISHtoFigure program.
