Supplementary Data for "FISHtoFigure: An easy-to-use pipeline for rapid, multi-target partitioning and analysis of sub-cellular mRNA transcripts in smFISH data". These data comprise the spleen dataset analysed in the publication with NaiveX_Y representing the Yth image taken from a spleen sample from the Xth mouse, and similarly for infected specimens. NC and PC represent the negative and positive controls for the RNAScope assay repectively.

Additionally, these data act as an example dataset for processing via the FISHtoFigure pipeline, for details on resutls of such analysis, see the publication here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.28.546871v1
